## 2026-02-09 — 3 Datasets Identified + Cleaned (Team)

**Context**: Setting up the “Predicting Potential Pandemic Diseases” project by finding datasets and cleaning them into a consistent weekly format.

**Work Completed**:
- Collected three datasets: Singapore, Australia, and COVID.
- Cleaned each dataset (fixed data types, handled missing values, removed duplicates).
- Standardized them into the same structure with a weekly date field (week_start_date) so they can be compared/combined.
  

**Impact**: All three datasets are now clean and consistent.

**Next Steps**: Combine them into one dataset (if needed) and start baseline modeling + evaluation.
